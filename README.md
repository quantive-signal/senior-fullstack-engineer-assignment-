# Take Home Assignment - Senior Full Stack 
### Interface + API application (Insight Card)
---
### Use the base code that was provided in this repo. Assignments lacking the aforementioned code will be denied right away. The technical interview will centre on the candidate's comprehension of the above code.

**IMPORTANT** : We will consider exclusively the quality of your project (technology and product-wise) to evaluate your work. We've added a project structure in this repository (a build with react, reflux, typescript, webpack, babel config etc) to save you time. Feel free to use it. The app will also have its own separate login mechanism based on a username and password. Go through the details clearly. You have        **7 days** to submit the assigned task. We of course want you to solve the problem, but are equally interested to see how you solve it - the quality of your approach & code!
In case of any questions, send a mail to nidhi@quantive.com

Quantive Signals monitors your KPIs and intelligently collects your data ,identifies anomalies, identifies factors that create unexpected changes, generates alerts and insights of when, what, and why something happens.

You will build a piece of our insights feature by creating the insight card screen.

**Evaluation**

Be aware that Origin will mainly take into consideration the following evaluation criteria:
- How close your page is to the mockups, both on mobile & desktop;
- How clean and organized your code is. We are looking for clear separation of back-end and front-end;
- If you implemented the business rules correctly.
- How good your automated tests are, i.e. qualitative over quantitative. Feel free to choose between jest or testing library.
- You are free to use any javascript chart library.

You can use third-party libraries in case you want to.

### What you have to make
---
**Sign up Screen**
- Create a sign up screen in the [host]/auth/register page.
- On Submit, create an entry of the registered user in the DB (e.g mongodb) of your choice.

**Login Screen**
- Create a login screen in the [host]/auth/login page.
- On Submit, validate the user and as soon as user gets logged in, user will redirect to [host]/organizations/quantive page where you will show your insight card screen.

**Insight Card**

Create list of at least 4-5 insight cards.  
Insight card will have the following components.
- **Insight card heading** - This will have the source logo and breadcrumb like structure i.e source_name/stream_name/kpi_name along with that, the severity i.e [high, medium, low] depending on the score i.e, 0-50 is low, 51-70 is medium and 71-100 is high. It should also have the watchers components. Suppose user1 was the owner of an insight and user2 (another logged in user) clicked that insight card, user2 will be added as the watcher for that insight and will be visible in the watchers component.
- **Insight card table** - insight card should have the table with the top-drivers. Show first 2 top drivers.
- **Insight card line graph** - insight card should also have line graph. You can use any javascript chart library to create it.
- **Save button** - insight card should have the save button. On submit, save the insight for that user. 
- **Filter** - create a filter based for severity and saved insights

- **Test Suit**

Ensure to write some basic test cases for this component in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Make sure you test if the component is rendered and saving/unSaving button works.

- **Change** Create a section where you show the change of the in the insight. Here you need to display the current and the previous value of the insight with respect to the `startTime` and `endTime` . The current and previous values should be abbreviate and timestamps should be formatted as per the design.

           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;" />


- **Insight Line Graph** Add a preview graph from the timeseries values for insights. The name of the file is in this manner `[insight_id].json`

![alt text](https://cliff-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/metric-graph.png)


The graph has a few different components, namely:

- The line representing the original value — this line uses the field `value`
- The dashed line representing the forecast — this line uses the field `forecastedValue`
- The portion of the main line representing an "anomaly", which is colored red — this portion uses the field `lineStatus`, the `lineStatus` can have the following values
    - `lineStatus: 0` - There is no anomaly in this line.
    - `lineStatus: 1` — The anomaly has started and hence the line should be colored red.
    - `lineStatus: 2` — The anomaly is continuing and hence the line should be colored red.
    - `lineStatus: 3` — The anomaly has ended, therefore the line should **not** be red.
- There should be "bands" around the main line (represented in the image above with the shaded grey area). These bands can be rendered using the fields `upperBound` and `lowerBound`. Also, the area within the band should be shaded.
- The x-axis should be based on the `timestamp` field and the y-axis should be based on the `value` field.

You can directly store the provided JSON files on your backend, but there are bonus points if you can store and query the data from a MongoDB instance (you can use MongoDB Atlas to get started with a free MongoDB provider).

### Usage
---
This project requires the latest LTS version of NodeJS and you may need to install the yarn as global dependency

```

```
yarn install
```
You can then start the application running:
```
yarn start
```
That's it. Just Access http://localhost:6001 in your browser.

**Again, please make sure your repository on GitHub is private.**


We hope you have fun with the assignment! In case of any questions or queries, feel free to shoot us an email at careers@greendeck.co. We are expecting a solution submission within seven days. While we're interested in the complete implementation of the task, feel free to submit your solution even if you feel if it's not up to the mark; we're as interested in your method of solving the problem as we're interested in the end result itself.

Good luck!
